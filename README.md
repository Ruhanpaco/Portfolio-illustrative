## Overview

This portfolio site features:

- A **contact page** with an interactive form to reach out, featuring animations and smooth transitions.
- **Responsive design**, ensuring it looks great on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes for a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatic language detection based on the user's location (EN, DE, SQ).
